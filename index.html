                <p class = writing>Arrow Development is an amusement ride construction company founded in 1945 by Angus "Andy" Anderson, Ed Morgan, William Hardiman, and Karl Bacon. The company's first ride was a merry go round at central park which then allowed them to get a job with Disney to create their beginning ride at their new park, Disneyland. The most notable ride was the matterhorn bobsled thrill ride. The company was later known for their looping coaster and mega lopper models in the 1980s. Their method of design tracks was tangent radius design i.e their rides were made of using circles and lines as each element had a constant curve.</p>

                <p class = writing> Bolliger and Mabillard is an amusement ride construction company founded in 1988 by Walter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard after they split off from their former company Givinola. The first ride that the company made after the split was Shockwave at Six flags Magic Mountain and Vortex at Kings Island in their first year. Both of these models were the stand up model which is one of ten different models B&M offers: Stand up, inverted, Hyper, Flying, Sit Down, Family, Dive, Floorless and Wing. The most technologically advanced coset is the flying coaster made by B&M, which has led to low capacity due to difficult restraints and high costs for building and operating.</p>

Fred Grubb got his start in construction by building a zoo exhibition and gold courses. In 2009 the team brought on ride designer Alan Schilke who had previosly design the 4th dimension coaster X at Arrow Development. in 2011 was when the company had built their first roller coaster using their new IBox track to turn old wooden coaster into new state of the art Hybrid coasters. In 2021 RMC showcased their new Raptor and t-rex tracks which are single rail coasters which keep the rides cheaper to produce and develop.</p>

In 1970 was when Vekoma became an amusement ride construction company working for Arrow Development when it was trying to install a ride in europe however after 1975 the started making their own coasters. Vekoma's most infamous model was its Suspended Looping Coaster or SLC for short. At the time these rides were praised but now the restraints used aren't the best So now Vekoma are replacing them with their new models </p>

                <p class = rides-writing>Magnum XL 200 is a hyper roller coaster built at cedar point in Sandusky, Ohio built by Arrow Dynamics in 1989. Magnum XL 200 was the world's first hyper coaster built in the world standing at 205 ft (62.5 metres) tall where in order for it to be a hyper coaster as define by cedar fair as a roller that is between 200-299 ft tall or have a drop thats 200-299 ft tall (62.5-91.1 metres). Just like arrow's coaster's at the time the design method used for creating the track was tangent radius design. Tangent radius design method is using consistent radii on turns and drops so for example the drop will go to 60 degrees then it will pull out of the the drop at a constant 60 degree angle, so a point you can make is that magnum xl 200 was built using lines and circles. The layout of the ride starts with a small drop after the station into a 90 degree turn to the right into the chain lift with a speed of 6 mph or 9.7 kmph, after ascending the lift hill a 194.7ft or 59.6meter drop at 60 degrees where the coaster reaches its maximum speed of 72 mph or 117 kph which is followed by a 157ft or 48 metre camelback hill. Then the ride goes into a slight curve into a tunnel, then it ascends a 80 ft or 24 metre tall hill before entering a pretzel turn around. after the trains follow seven airtime hills before going into another tunnel reaching the midcourse break run as it takes a 90 degree turn back to the station. </p>            </div>

                <p class = rides-writing>Superman Ultimate Flight is a flying coaster built by manufacturer Bolliger and Mabillard or B&M for short, opened in 2002. The flying coaster model by B&M is the most advanced roller coaster train in the world having three restraint systems and having a rotating train to allow for loading passengers. The train starts in the hanging position where riders will sit down the chair and pull down the hydraulic over the shoulder restraint as simultaneously leg flap close in to hold your angles straight. After the resight check the train will rotate 90 degrees placing rides in the flying position.Superman: Ultimate Flight begins as the train turns to the right and begins to climb the 106-foot-tall (32 m) chain lift hill. After cresting the top of the lift hill, the train drops 100 feet (30 m) to the right at a 50-degree-angle, reaching a top speed of 51 miles per hour (82 km/h) and preparing to enter the pretzel loop. In a pretzel loop, a train swoops up to a height of 78 feet (24 m) before diving toward the ground, looping back under the starting point. At the bottom of the loop, riders face upward and experience strong, positive g forces. To complete the pretzel loop, the train climbs back to the top of the element, parallel to where it started. After exiting the element, the train then enters a 270-degree turn to the left, dropping back through the middle of the pretzel loop. Next, the train passes through two consecutive horseshoe turns, first to the right and then to the left. As the name suggests, Horseshoe turns are highly banked horseshoe-shaped turns which feature track entering from roughly the same direction as where it exits. As the train exits the second horseshoe, it swoops down and begins a 270-degree helix to the right, which leads into the ride's second inversion, an inline twist. The inline twist sees riders perform a full rotation around the track, starting from a position where they are facing downward. After completing the twist, the train reaches the brake run and a final right-hand turn that leads back into the station.</p>           </div>

                <p class = rides-writing>Iron Gwazi from Gwazi is hybrid coaster built by RMC which open in March 31 2022 in Bush gardens tampa bay in Tampa, Florida. a hybrid coaster is ride type pionered by RMC as they would take aging wooden coasters and giving then new life in making them taller faster and wilder, this option is amazing for parks as its cheeper then replacing the ride as RMC in order to reduce coaster will reuse structual supports. Iron Gwazi begins with a sharp left-hand turn, followed by a descending turn leading to the 206 ft (63 m) lift hill. As the train crests the hill, it slows down before descending its 91-degree drop, reaching its top speed of 76 mph (122 km/h). The train then climbs a hill and banks in the opposite direction making an outer-bank turn, returning downward in a left-hand turn and upwards to the right. Reaching the apex of the hill, the train navigates through a barrel roll downdrop, followed by an overbanked turn to the left. The train climbs above the station and banks outward to perform an extended wave turn until flattening out. The train continues to climb a series of left-curved hills, transitioning into a zero-g stall. Completing the stall, the train traverses a small outer-banked hill and continues into a series of upward-curved hills to the right. Iron Gwazi finishes with a turnaround into a hill and a left turn into the final brake run. Upon completion, the train makes a left turn passing the car barn, and a last right turn before entering the station. One cycle of the roller coaster takes about two minutes to complete.</p>

Arkham Asylum is SLC made by Vekoma with trains later supled by Kumba. the ride was built in 1995 before being closed in 2019 and scrapt in jully 2022 to make money for their new Hypercoaster. The train climbed the 33.3-metre (109 ft) lift hill, before dropping down a steep, curved drop to the right. The train then entered the rollover, followed by a hill with a banked turn to the left. At the bottom of the hill was a sidewinder (similar to an Immelman loop), followed by a 270-degree turn to the right. Next was two inline twists. Upon exiting this element riders experienced a download 180-degree turn to the right. Unlike most Vekoma Suspended Looping Roller Coasters, Arkham Asylum featured an additional helix just before the brake run. This element was referred to as the "bayern kurve" by Vekoma and was the first to be installed in any Suspended Looping Roller Coaster.</p>
