The most notable ride was the matterhorn bobsled thrill ride. The company was later known for their looping coaster and mega lopper models in the 1980s. Their method of design tracks was tangent radius design i.e their rides were made of using circles and lines as each element had a constant curve.</p>

                <p class = writing> Bolliger and Mabillard is an amusement ride construction company founded in 1988 by Walter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard after they split off from their former company Givinola. The first ride that the company made after the split was Shockwave at Six flags Magic Mountain and Vortex at Kings Island in their first year. Both of these models were the stand up model which is one of ten different models B&M offers: Stand up, inverted, Hyper, Flying, Sit Down, Family, Dive, Floorless and Wing. The most technologically advanced coset is the flying coaster made by B&M, which has led to low capacity due to difficult restraints and high costs for building and operating.
